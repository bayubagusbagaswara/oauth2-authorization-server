# OAuth 2.0

`OAuth 2.0`, which stands for "Open Authorization", is a standard designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user.

- OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol and NOT an authentication protocol
- It is designed primarily as a means of granting access to a set of resources. For example, remote APIs or user's data
- OAuth 2.0 uses Access Tokens
